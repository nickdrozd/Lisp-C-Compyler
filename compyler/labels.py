# for this to work, numbers can't be used 
# in label names. for instance, 
# makeLabel('hello1') yields 'hello11' when 
# first called ('hello1' + '1'), and if 
# makeLabel is called nine more times and 
# then called with 'hello', it will yield 
# 'hello11' ('hello' + '11'). how could this 
# be avoided aside from restricting input?

# different numberings for different strings?
# that would make the code easier to follow
